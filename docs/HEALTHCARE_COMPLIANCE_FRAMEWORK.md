### 2. Consent Management
- Granular consent permissions with specific data categories
- Consent lifecycle management (draft, proposed, active, revoked)
- Automatic consent expiration handling
- Digital signature validation for consent records

### 3. Audit Trail System
- Comprehensive activity logging for all data access
- HIPAA-compliant audit events with detailed metadata
- Real-time compliance monitoring
- Audit log retention and querying capabilities

### 4. Data Breach Management

- Active vs. revoked consent counts
- Breach reports and resolution status
- Compliance score (0-100)
- Pending violation tracking

### Regular Maintenance
- Periodic compliance score reviews
- Audit log retention management
- Consent expiration monitoring
- Breach response follow-up tracking

This comprehensive framework ensures robust healthcare compliance while maintaining the flexibility and scalability required for modern healthcare applications.


## HIPAA Minimum Necessary Standard — Consent Scope

HIPAA requires access to be limited to the minimum data necessary for the stated purpose
(45 CFR §164.514(d)).

### ConsentScope Variants

Access grants include a `Vec<ConsentScope>` field restricting which record categories are readable:

| Variant | Description |
|---|---|
| `Diagnosis` | Diagnostic findings only |
| `Medication` | Medication lists and prescriptions |
| `Imaging` | Radiology and imaging results |
| `Genomic` | Genetic/genomic data |
| `MentalHealth` | Behavioral health records |
| `AllRecords` | Unrestricted access (requires explicit grant) |

### Access Control Flow

1. Grantee calls `read_record(patient_id, record_id)`.
2. Contract checks the record category is in the grantee's `ConsentScope`.
3. Out-of-scope access returns `Err(ContractError::ScopeNotGranted)`.
4. Every access attempt is recorded in the audit log with its scope.

### Compliance Mapping

| HIPAA Requirement | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Minimum Necessary | `ConsentScope` field on every consent grant |
| Out-of-scope rejection | `ScopeNotGranted` error code |
| Audit logging | Scope recorded in every access log entry |

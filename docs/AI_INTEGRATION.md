# AI/ML Integration Documentation and Ethics Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the AI/ML capabilities integrated into the Uzima Healthcare Platform. The system provides privacy-preserving machine learning for medical record analysis while maintaining patient privacy and regulatory compliance.

For details on how these AI signals are surfaced in dashboards and analytics tooling, see the [Uzima Analytics Platform](ANALYTICS_PLATFORM.md).

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Federated Learning Contract** (`federated_learning`)
   - Enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data
   - Implements differential privacy mechanisms
   - Supports secure aggregation of model updates

2. **Anomaly Detection Contract** (`anomaly_detection`)
   - Identifies unusual patterns in medical records
   - Provides configurable sensitivity thresholds
   - Generates explainable anomaly reports

3. **Predictive Analytics Contract** (`predictive_analytics`)
   - Performs risk assessments and outcome predictions
   - Supports multiple prediction types (diabetes risk, heart attack probability, etc.)
   - Maintains confidence intervals for predictions

4. **Explainable AI Contract** (`explainable_ai`)
   - Provides model interpretability features
   - Generates feature importance rankings
   - Conducts bias audits and fairness testing

5. **Medical Records Integration** (`medical_records`)
   - Contains AI integration hooks
   - Stores AI-generated insights securely
   - Maintains privacy controls for AI access

## Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms

### Differential Privacy

All AI models incorporate differential privacy to protect individual patient data:

- **Epsilon Budget**: Each participant has a privacy budget that limits the amount of information that can be extracted
- **Noise Addition**: Strategic noise addition prevents identification of individuals in datasets
- **Privacy Accounting**: Tracks cumulative privacy loss across multiple queries

### Federated Learning

- Models are trained across decentralized data sources
- Raw data never leaves the originating institution
- Secure aggregation protocols protect model updates
- Participant anonymity is maintained

### Access Controls

- AI coordinators are specifically authorized addresses
- Patient consent is required for AI analysis
- Granular permissions for different types of AI insights
- Audit trails for all AI access to medical data

## AI Model Training and Inference

### Training Pipelines

The system provides automated training pipelines:

```bash
./scripts/ai_pipeline.sh --type federated --action train --data ./data --output ./models
```

### Model Types

1. **Federated Models**
   - Trained across multiple institutions
   - Use differential privacy by default
   - Suitable for population-level insights

2. **Anomaly Detection Models**
   - Identify unusual patient patterns
   - Configurable sensitivity levels
   - Real-time monitoring capabilities

3. **Predictive Models**
   - Risk assessment algorithms
   - Outcome prediction models
   - Personalized care recommendations

### Model Versioning

All models are versioned and tracked:

- Immutable model IDs using cryptographic hashes
- Provenance tracking for training data
- Performance metrics and bias audits recorded
- Reproducible training procedures

## Ethical Guidelines

### Fairness and Bias Mitigation

1. **Algorithmic Auditing**
   - Regular bias audits using the Explainable AI contract
   - Demographic parity testing
   - Equalized odds verification
   - Calibration checks across groups

2. **Inclusive Design**
   - Diverse training datasets
   - Representative validation sets
   - Ongoing monitoring for disparate impact

3. **Transparency**
   - Clear documentation of model limitations
   - Disclosure of known biases
   - Interpretability requirements for clinical decisions

### Patient Rights

1. **Consent**
   - Explicit consent required for AI analysis
   - Right to opt-out of AI processing
   - Clear explanation of AI usage

2. **Explainability**
   - Patients can request explanations for AI insights
   - Clinicians must be able to interpret AI recommendations
   - Right to human review of AI decisions

3. **Data Minimization**
   - Only necessary data used for AI models
   - Purpose limitation for data usage
   - Automatic data deletion policies

### Clinical Validation

1. **Human Oversight**
   - AI recommendations require clinician validation
   - Critical decisions remain human-led
   - Clear delineation of AI vs. human responsibilities

2. **Safety Monitoring**
   - Continuous monitoring of AI performance
   - Rapid response to degraded performance
   - Model retirement protocols

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Zero-knowledge protocols where applicable
- Secure multi-party computation for joint analysis
- Regular security audits

### Model Security

- Adversarial attack resistance
- Model inversion protection
- Membership inference prevention
- Robust model validation

## Compliance Framework

### Regulatory Alignment

- HIPAA compliance for US healthcare data
- GDPR alignment for European data protection
- Local healthcare regulations adherence
- Professional medical association guidelines

### Audit Requirements

- Comprehensive logging of all AI interactions
- Regular third-party security audits
- Transparent reporting of model performance
- Continuous compliance monitoring

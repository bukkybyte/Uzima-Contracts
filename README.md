# 🌟 Stellar Uzima - Decentralized Medical Records on Stellar

Stellar Uzima is a decentralized smart contract system for secure, encrypted, and role-based management of medical records on the Stellar blockchain using Soroban and Rust. The project enables healthcare providers and patients to maintain control over sensitive medical data while ensuring privacy, immutability, and auditability. Built specifically for healthcare organizations transitioning to blockchain-based record keeping, the system also respects traditional healing practices by supporting metadata for indigenous medical records.

The platform provides a comprehensive solution for modern healthcare data management, combining the security benefits of blockchain technology with practical healthcare workflows. It's designed for hospitals, clinics, research institutions, and healthcare providers who need to maintain patient confidentiality while enabling secure data sharing between authorized parties.

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, security scanning, and deployment.

### GitHub Actions Workflows

#### Continuous Integration (CI)

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push and pull request:

- **Code Formatting**: Checks code formatting with `cargo fmt`
- **Linting**: Runs Clippy with strict warnings
- **Unit Tests**: Executes all unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: Runs integration tests with Soroban CLI
- **Build**: Builds optimized WASM contracts
- **Shell Script Linting**: Validates shell scripts with ShellCheck

```bash
# View CI status
# Check the "Actions" tab on GitHub or:
gh workflow view ci.yml
```

#### Security Scanning

The security workflow (`.github/workflows/security.yml`) performs automated security checks:

- **Dependency Audit**: Scans for known vulnerabilities with `cargo-audit`
- **Security-focused Clippy**: Checks for security anti-patterns
- **Secret Scanning**: Detects hardcoded secrets with Gitleaks
- **Dependency Review**: Reviews dependency changes in PRs

Runs on:
- Every push to main/develop branches
- Pull requests
- Daily at 2 AM UTC (scheduled)

#### Automated Testnet Deployment

The deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-testnet.yml`) automatically deploys to testnet:

**Triggers:**
- Pushes to `develop` branch
- Version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Process:**
1. Runs pre-deployment tests (unless skipped)
2. Builds optimized contracts
3. Deploys to testnet
4. Verifies deployments
5. Creates deployment summary

**Configuration:**

Set up the following GitHub secrets:
- `TESTNET_DEPLOYER_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for testnet deployment account

```bash
# Manual deployment via GitHub Actions
gh workflow run deploy-testnet.yml \
  --field contract=medical_records \
  --field skip_tests=false
```

### Deployment Scripts

#### Enhanced Deployment with Rollback

Deploy contracts with automatic backup and rollback support:

```bash
# Deploy with rollback enabled (default)
./scripts/deploy_with_rollback.sh medical_records testnet

# Deploy without rollback
./scripts/deploy_with_rollback.sh medical_records testnet default --no-rollback
```

**Features:**
- Automatic backup of current deployment
- Rollback on deployment failure
- Contract verification after deployment
- Deployment metadata tracking

#### Environment-based Deployment

Deploy all contracts to a specific environment:

```bash
# Deploy all contracts to testnet
./scripts/deploy_environment.sh testnet

# Deploy specific contracts
./scripts/deploy_environment.sh testnet --contracts medical_records,identity_registry

# Skip tests (not recommended)
./scripts/deploy_environment.sh testnet --skip-tests
```

**Environments:**
- `local`: Local development network
- `testnet`: Stellar testnet
- `futurenet`: Stellar futurenet (staging)
- `mainnet`: Production mainnet (requires confirmation)

#### Deployment Monitoring

Monitor deployed contracts and receive alerts:

```bash
# Monitor all deployments on testnet
./scripts/monitor_deployments.sh testnet

# Monitor with alerts on failure
./scripts/monitor_deployments.sh testnet --alert-on-failure
```

**Features:**
- Health checks for all deployed contracts
- Contract verification
- Alert generation for unhealthy contracts
- Deployment status reporting

#### Rollback Deployment

Rollback a contract to a previous version:

```bash
# Interactive rollback (selects latest backup)
./scripts/rollback_deployment.sh medical_records testnet

# Rollback to specific backup
./scripts/rollback_deployment.sh medical_records testnet \
  deployments/testnet_medical_records_backup_20240101_120000.json
```

**Process:**
1. Lists available backups
2. Verifies backup contract exists
3. Restores deployment configuration
4. Logs rollback action

#### Deployment Status

View deployment status across all networks:

```bash
# Show all deployments
./scripts/deployment_status.sh

# Show deployments for specific network
./scripts/deployment_status.sh testnet
```

**Information displayed:**
- Contract names and IDs
- Deployment timestamps
- Rollback status
- Backup availability
- Rollback history

### Deployment Workflow

#### Standard Deployment Process

1. **Development**: Make changes and test locally
   ```bash
   make test
   make build-opt
   ```

2. **CI Validation**: Push to branch triggers CI
   - Tests run automatically
   - Security scans execute
   - Build artifacts created

3. **Testnet Deployment**: Merge to `develop` triggers testnet deployment
   - Contracts deployed automatically
   - Verification runs
   - Status reported

4. **Production Deployment**: Manual deployment to mainnet
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy_environment.sh mainnet
   ```

#### Rollback Process

If a deployment fails or issues are detected:

1. **Identify Issue**: Check deployment logs and monitoring
   ```bash
   ./scripts/monitor_deployments.sh testnet
   ```

2. **Review Backups**: List available backups
   ```bash
   ./scripts/rollback_deployment.sh medical_records testnet
   ```

3. **Execute Rollback**: Restore previous version
   ```bash
   ./scripts/rollback_deployment.sh medical_records testnet <backup_file>
   ```

4. **Verify**: Confirm rollback success
   ```bash
   ./scripts/monitor_deployments.sh testnet
   ```

### Deployment Artifacts

Deployment information is stored in the `deployments/` directory:

```
deployments/
├── testnet_medical_records.json          # Current deployment
├── testnet_medical_records_backup_*.json # Backup files
├── rollback_log.json                     # Rollback history
└── alerts.log                            # Alert log
```

**Deployment File Format:**
```json
{
  "contract_name": "medical_records",
  "contract_id": "C...",
  "network": "testnet",
  "deployer": "deployer-testnet",
  "deployed_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "wasm_hash": "...",
  "commit_sha": "..."
}
```

### CI/CD Best Practices

1. **Always run tests locally** before pushing
2. **Review CI results** before merging PRs
3. **Monitor deployments** after each release
4. **Keep backups** for critical deployments
5. **Use rollback** when issues are detected
6. **Document** any manual deployment steps

### Troubleshooting

#### CI Failures

- **Formatting errors**: Run `cargo fmt --all`
- **Clippy warnings**: Fix warnings or add `#[allow(...)]` with justification
- **Test failures**: Review test output and fix issues
- **Build failures**: Check Rust version and dependencies

#### Deployment Failures

- **Network issues**: Verify network connectivity and RPC endpoints
- **Insufficient funds**: Fund deployment account
- **Contract errors**: Check contract logs and verify WASM file
- **Identity issues**: Ensure identity is properly configured

#### Rollback Issues

- **No backups**: Previous deployments weren't backed up
- **Invalid backup**: Backup file may be corrupted
- **Contract not found**: Backup contract may have been removed
